# JSON Explorer

Explore the structure and contents of a group of JSONs, like responses
from an API.

### Installation

```
pip install json-explorer
```

JSON Explorer is a small tool with no dependencies and is tested in
Python 3.7+.

### Getting started

Get started by writing a few JSONs you want to explore to a file, one
per line. Then run `json-explorer` from the command line:

```
json-explorer data_from_an_undocumented_API.jsonl
```

If you just want to try it out but don't have JSONs in a file, you can
run `json-explorer --example` to see how it works with example data.

This will pop up a web page that helps you explore the properties of
the objects, what data types are in there, what values are unique, and
more.

From there, you might use `jq` or `jmespath` to write something to
more read the data that you're interested in using.

For more details, see the [full
documentation](https://stringertheory.github.io/json-explorer/>).


### Other tools to help with JSON data

This tool is intended for quick and dirty exploration of JSONs. If
that's not what you need, there are a *lot* of great resources for
working with JSON data. Here is an [awesome
list](https://github.com/burningtree/awesome-json).

There are a couple tools in the python ecosystem that complement JSON
Explorer:

- [GenSON](https://github.com/wolverdude/genson/) can create a [JSON
  Schema](https://json-schema.org/) from a group of JSONs.

- [jmespath.py](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.py). The official
  Python implementation fo the JMESPath query language for JSON.

Also, there are many tools for viewing/navigating individual JSONs, a 

- [JSON View](https://jsonview.com/). A simple browser extension to
  view JSONs, that's available for several browsers.

- [JSON Hero](https://jsonhero.io/). A full-featured JSON
  visualization tool.
